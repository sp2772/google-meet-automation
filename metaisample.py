Okay, I need to talk. Nothing random. hey, no matter, three minutes ago, I not say Oh no. Oh my God. Now, in trouble. But you're not, I don't know that. I Okay. Now shall we start the meat? Yeah. So today's meat is about how do you care about your batteries new batteries? so batteries when you buy them it it looks very good, it has so much capacity or so excited but
Now shall we start the meat? Yeah. So today's meat is about how do you care about your batteries new batteries? So batteries when you buy them it it looks very good. It has so much capacity or so excited, but then there is something you need to do for it a long last, right? the moment you buy a battery your expecting it to work long, but then,
So batteries when you buy them it it looks very good. It has so much capacity or so excited, but then there is something you need to do for it a long last, right? The moment you buy a battery your expecting it to work long, but then if what if it doesn't work, like the way you expected and it gets depleted, the next day and your charge don't just stay in your phone.
The moment you buy a battery your expecting it to work long, but then if what if it doesn't work, like the way you expected and it gets depleted, the next day and your charge don't just stay in your phone or any laptop. So, We will talk about how we can actually stop this and take good care of.
if what if it doesn't work, like the way you expected and it gets depleted, the next day and your charge don't just stay in your phone or any laptop. So, We will talk about how we can actually stop this and take good care of your battery. So the first thing you have to do is don't charge the battery more than 90%. Why? Why? Because the battery is something.
or any laptop. So, We will talk about how we can actually stop this and take good care of your battery. So the first thing you have to do is don't charge the battery more than 90%. Why? Why? Because the battery is something similar to a capacitor. So, in a capacitor, the charging capacity or the discharging capacity is, it's inversely proportion.
Because the battery is something similar to a capacitor. So, in a capacitor, the charging capacity or the discharging capacity is it's inversely proportional or sometimes exponentially. Proportional to the time, it takes to charge. So at the start of starting off your charging, it's almost    
So, in a capacitor, the charging capacity or the discharging capacity is it's inversely proportional or sometimes exponentially. Proportional to the time, it takes to charge. So at the start of starting off your charging, it's almost the slowly. But then slowly, there it charges exponentially. And that's a certain point like around 90 or 9 Person.
Proportional to the time, it takes to charge. So at the start of starting off your charging, it's almost the slowly. But then slowly, there it charges exponentially. And that's a certain point like around 90 or 9 Person that these charges will. Get into a saturation state. So, a graph between the capacity, capacitance. And the time when
So at the start of starting off your charging, it's almost the slowly. But then slowly, there it charges exponentially. And that's a certain point like around 90 or 9 Person that these charges will. Get into a saturation state. so, a graph between the capacity, capacitance, and the time, when charging can be used to analyze this, used to analyz, So, this saturation happens when
around 90 or 9 Person that these charges will. Get into a saturation state. so, a graph between the capacity, capacitance, and the time, when charging can be used to analyze this, used to analyz, So, this saturation happens when You charge more than 95%. So why do these charges go? What do you mean by saturation? So, the saturation point at saturation, point the
used to analyz, So, this saturation happens when You charge more than 95%. So why do these charges go? What do you mean by saturation? So the saturation point at saturation point, the charges actually won't go inside the capacitor. It stays in the some 99.99% it won't go hundred percent but instead these charges get converted into
point, the charges actually won't go inside the capacitor. It stays in the some 99.99% it won't go hundred percent but instead these charges get converted into Heat energy. And these charges actually escape from your battery and gets converted into heat energy, the more you charge. So after a certain point,
It stays in the some 99.99% it won't go hundred percent but instead these charges get converted into Heat energy. And these charges actually escape from your battery and gets converted into heat energy, the more you charge. So after a certain point you can see your phone getting heated up. So that's why you should not charge the battery more than three minutes.
And these charges actually escape from your battery and gets converted into heat energy, the more you charge. So after a certain point you can see your phone getting heated up. So that's why you should not charge the battery more than three minutes. Oh, sorry. More than 99%, sorry. Anyways, the next thing you have to care about is not discharging below 5%.
your phone getting heated up. So that's why you should not charge the battery more than three minutes. Oh, sorry. More than 99%, sorry. Anyways, the next thing you have to care about is not discharging below 5%. So why, because when the electrolyte inside the battery gets depleted, of its ions, the electrolyte becomes neutral instead of
x999so batteries are very costly and they should be taken care so thats how it is the metasaur evil account number in a something wrong metaphor evil account something is happening okay i need to talk
